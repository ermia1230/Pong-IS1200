hello there
If you want to play the game. Have fun!
in this game, there are 2 switches that work and all the 4 buttons. 
in order to play the game at the start, please make sure that  switch 1 , the one on the right, is set to one
Wait a seconed and make sure that you take the switch down. It should be one for just a moment. 
If you forget to take down the switch to 0 after 1,2 seconeds, the game will not work. 
the buttons are for the padels to go up and down 
Make sure that switch 2 is set to 0 
Btn 1 will make the right padel to go down 
Btn 2 will make the right padel to go up 
Btn 3 will make the left  padel to go down 
Btn 4 will make the left padel to go up 
If you want the game to continue without showing who wins, make switch 2 set to 1 all the time 
otherwise let it be zero. 
after a side wins and it is displayed on the screen, if you want to reset the game, let the switch 2 be set to 1 for just 1 seconed
by doing this, the game will be reset. 
That is all you need to know in order to  enjoy playing my game,
